Mozarts-Ear
===========

Mozart’s Ear is a music transcriber. Analogous to speech-to-text software, it does
music-to-notation of unaccompanied melodies. Music transcription is very useful for
musicians but difficult to learn and laborious to execute. Once a melody is transcribed,
the app is able to do simple melodic analysis, identifying features such as the key of the
selection, motives, moments of exact repetition, triads and scalar motion. Identification
of these melodic features is useful for people trying to engage intelligently with the
music either when memorising a passage (for performance), trying to understand its
construction (for analysis by a composer), or naming features to discuss their effect or
significance (for the musicologist).
Simply, Mozart’s Ear puts into the palm of users the ability to hear like Mozart
without spending hours in a practice room.
